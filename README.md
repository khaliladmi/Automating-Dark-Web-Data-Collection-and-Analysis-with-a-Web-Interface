# Automating-Dark-Web-Data-Collection-and-Analysis-with-a-Web-Interface
This project develops an advanced Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform that integrates MISP with OpenCTI, enhanced by an AI/NLP pipeline for automated threat analysis and dark web monitoring. The goal is to improve cyber threat detection, enrichment, and sharing by leveraging artificial intelligence for natural language processingâ€”making threat intelligence workflows more robust and actionable.

# Key Features:

Automated dark web data scraping and analysis

AI-powered NLP for entity extraction and IOC/indicator enrichment

Seamless integration between MISP and OpenCTI for structured threat knowledge

Comprehensive Docker-based setup for reproducibility

All commands, installation steps, and troubleshooting logs included for future reference
